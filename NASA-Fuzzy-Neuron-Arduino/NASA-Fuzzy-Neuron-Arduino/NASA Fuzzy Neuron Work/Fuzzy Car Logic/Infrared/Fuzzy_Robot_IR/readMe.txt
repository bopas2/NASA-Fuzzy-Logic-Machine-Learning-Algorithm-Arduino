Program that uses user inputs and two infrared sensors to "learn" how to drive.

In reality, because the IR sensors have bad range, and only output binary numbers, this program is not useful.
(absolute outputs [1 or 0] remove the point of fuzzification).

However, it did lay down the foundations for the ultrasonic sensors version of the algorithim.
