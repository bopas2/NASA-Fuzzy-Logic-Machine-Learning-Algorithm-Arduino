The best of all worlds.

Uses peripheral ultrasonic sensors which reads information from forward/side views.

Uses a 'unicorn' infrared sensor who's sole purpose is to detect whether or not the car is about to crash.
(mounted to point directly where the car is orriented).

This combination allows for the best results in collision avoidance.
